## Quickstart

TODO

### Prerequisites

TODO

### How to run localy

TODO

## Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Design

For this app, I decided to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for V part of application and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for application state management.
Some part of my motivation about these technologies will be in other parts of this doc.

Briefly, React provide for us good and really flexible solution for View layer + some trivial state management out of the box.
Also, it will provide for us components which will help us make the app more simple and stable(as it easy to work with independt parts).
And last good thing, React one of the most popular libraries in FE community, so it is really easy to find answers to any questions and to find libs that you need.
(Angular 4, Ember, Vue, etc. also provide smth like this, but they are very different from React and provide more complex(all-in-one) solutions,
which we could disscuss in PM)

Let us begin from small UML-like diagram to describe main parts of our app and relations between them

![](./docs/Chat-ui-diagram.png)

Small notes about it:
We will have a provider which will provide for our store and give us the ability to select data from it and to dispatch actions.
We will have several clever components - Containers, they will retrieve data from the store and send it to children + handle actions.
We will have SocketIO and Local/Session storage connectors, they will communicate with the main container and redux(initial state).

### Folder Structure
